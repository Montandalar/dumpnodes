dumpnodes
=========

dumpnodes is a tiny little mod that accompanies the mt-mapper program for
generating top-down world maps.

Dumpnodes adds one command `/dumpnodes` that will dump all of the node 
definitions in your minetest world to a text file 'nodes.txt' in the world 
directory. It is included with mt-mapper but this is a standalone version.

This particular mod was written by sfan5.
